<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This product is in very early development and **SHOULD NOT BE USED YET**. 

If you are looking for a project that is reliable and ready to be used, head over to [https://www.microcovid.org](https://www.microcovid.org) ([source on GitHub](https://github.com/microcovid/microcovid)).

In the near future, this app will let you keep a local journal of every activity that has some risk of contracting COVID-19 and compute your accumulated risk.

I'm currently building a command line interface because that's the easiest kind of front end for me. I'm planning to extract the application logic and add apps for Android / iOS later via [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) or some similiar technology.
